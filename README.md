# HPC Experimentation

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the experimentation with various optimization methods on bare metal High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. It includes work from the EC527: High Performance Programming with Multicore and GPUs
course at Boston University, taught by Martin Herbordt.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 0: Intro to CPUs
- Description: Introduction to CPU architectures and their impact on performance.

### Lab 1: Memory Optimization on CPU
- Description: Techniques for optimizing memory usage on CPU systems.

### Lab 2: Loop-Unrolling and Accumulators
- Description: Exploring the effects of loop unrolling and accumulator patterns in code optimization.

### Lab 3: Accumulators vs SSE and AVX
- Description: Comparative analysis of accumulators against SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) in HPC.

### Lab 4: Pthread Intro
- Description: An introduction to using Pthreads for parallel programming in HPC environments.

### Lab 5: Successive Over-Relaxation on CPU
- Description: Implementing and analyzing the Successive Over-Relaxation technique on CPU.

### Lab 6: OpenMP vs Pthreads for Matrix-Matrix Multiply
- Description: Comparing the performance of OpenMP and Pthreads in matrix-matrix multiplication scenarios.

### Lab 7: Successive Over-Relaxation on CPU vs GPU
- Description: A study on the efficiency of Successive Over-Relaxation technique on both CPU and GPU.

### Lab 8: Matrix-Matrix Multiply on GPU and CPU
- Description: Investigation of matrix-matrix multiplication performance on different hardware architectures.

## Credits
Special thanks to Martin Herbordt for creating the EC527 course at Boston University, which inspired and informed much of the work in this repository. Additionally, heartfelt gratitude to Evan Lang for his collaboration in submitting each one of these assignments with me.
